Lavalamp

######"It's like a lava lamp, but you can _cut_ the lava."

This is a small(ish) demo I made that uses [metaballs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) to kinda-sorta simulate the effects of a lava lamp. I used [this](http://www.geisswerks.com/ryan/BLOBS/blobs.html) page as a guide to implementing my balls. The balls can also be "cut" by swiping them with the mouse cursor.

An example page can be found here: http://harubex.github.io/Lavalamp
