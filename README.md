Lavalamp

######"It's like a lava lamp, but you can _move_ the lava."

This is a small(ish) demo I made that uses [metaballs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) to kinda-sorta simulate the effects of a lava lamp. I used [this](http://www.geisswerks.com/ryan/BLOBS/blobs.html) page as a guide to implementing the balls. One of the balls can be moved by using the mouse cursor.
