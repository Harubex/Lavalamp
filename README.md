Lavalamp
========

###### It's like a lava lamp, but you can _move_ the lava. #######

This is a small(ish) demo I made that uses [metaballs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) to kinda-sorta simulate the effects of a lava lamp. I used [this](http://www.geisswerks.com/ryan/BLOBS/blobs.html) page as a guide to implementing my balls.

It also works on mobile, if you're into that sort of thing.

#### Notes (05/2018) ####

This was my first real effort at making something I could be proud of. I've thought about making changes - cleaning it up, maybe swapping jQuery UI out for something more reasonable. Honestly though, it's nice looking back at this as it is. I get to think about how far I've come in the last 4 years. I think that's kinda neat.
